Wow! My first project is live. The last six weeks have been a whirlwind of emotions - excitement, frustration, uncertainty, and no shortage of "a-ha" moments. Walking into this program, I had zero coding experience beyond manipulating copy and paste HTML formats for Myspace page fifteen years ago. I've come a long way from emo haircuts and cheesy band lyrics though, so I knew this had to be something completely different. 

As I was thinking about my project and what I wanted to work on, I thought about what might be culturally relevant now (hint: it's not My Chemical Romance, though they are doing a reunion tour) and I settled on television. In the last ten years, we have watched Netflix grow from a mail-order DVD service to an Oscar winning movie platform. Amazon has not only changed the way that we shop, but is now producing Emmy award winning television shows. We are truly living in the golden age of television and that is, in large part, thanks to tech. 

Unfortunately, Netflix took down its public API several years ago, but I found another database that provides information for television. I decided to work with this database and build a simple program that would allow the user to search a list of television genres to find something to watch. From there the user can dig further and find an overview of each specific show to determine if the show is, in fact, bingeworthy.

One of the challenges I faced in this was needing to tie together two API requests from the same database. In working with my instructor, I realized that there would almost never be a time in the real world where this WOULDN'T be the norm, but having only attended one short lecture on how to even work with an API, this proved challenging. Through hard work and a lot of WTF moments though, I was able to produce a project that I am proud of, while managing not to pull my hair out in the process. And that's a good thing - because there's a lot less of it than there was in the days of Myspace.
